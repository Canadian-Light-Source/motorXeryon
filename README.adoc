This driver targets the `XD` controllers from Xeryon.
So far only the `XD-M` is tested, and only in single axis configuration.

== Disclaimer
This driver is heavily influenced by a device driver developed by Tadej Humar (Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland).

== Setup
Each stage comes with a set of parameters that need to be loaded into the controller manually.
There is no methode to load the vendor file at the moment.
