= Xeryon commands relevant to the motorRecord

== Setup
The driver will set `INFO=0` to switch off the status streaming of the ontroller.

== Command set
This is a list of commands used by the driver.
It's only a subset of the full command set.
Refer to the controller manual for details.

[NOTE]
====
`STOP` seems dagerous, as it requires `CONT` to resume operation.
As the motorRecord isfamous for blaring stop all the time, this might need some attention.
